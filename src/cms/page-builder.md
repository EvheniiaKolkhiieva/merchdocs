Page Builder makes it easy to create content-rich pages with custom layouts that enhance your visual storytelling, and drive customer engagement and loyalty. Here are just a few of the many Page Builder features that are designed to improve quality, and reduce the time and expense of producing custom pages:

- Advanced content tools
- Full-page layouts for CMS pages, products, and categories
- Real-time editing from the workspace
- Drag and drop page design
- Rich assortment of content types
- Custom product attribute input types

Starting with Magento 2.4.1, content editing is now full-screen only for all areas controlled by Page Builder. This includes CMS pages, product and category pages, blocks, and dynamic blocks. Full-screen editing puts the focus on your content and provides a view that better matches the user experience on the storefront.
