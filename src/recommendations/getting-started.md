Given the ever-changing complexities of online shopping, what works best for your storefront is often a combination of multiple key technologies. Using both Product Recommendations and [Product Relationships]({% link marketing/product-relationships.md %}) gives you more flexibility when it comes to promoting products. You can leverage Product Recommendations powered by Adobe Sensei to intelligently automate your recommendations at scale. Then, you can leverage [Related Product Rules]({% link marketing/product-related-rules.md %}) when you need to manually intervene and ensure a specific recommendation is being made to a target shopper segment, or when certain business goals need to be met.

Product recommendations allow you to:

- Choose from nine distinct intelligent recommendation types based on the following areas: shopper-based, item-based, popularity-based, trending, and similarity-based
- Use behavioral data to personalize recommendations throughout the shopperâ€™s storefront journey
- Measure key metrics relevant to each recommendation to help you understand the impact of your recommendations
