The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to all entities that store, process, and/or transmit cardholder data. It covers technical and operational practices for system components included in or connected to environments with cardholder data. If you accept or process payment cards, PCI DSS applies to you.

## The 4 PCI Compliance Levels

Not all businesses process the same number of card payments per year and each has a different level of risk of data breaches and security incidents, so the PCI SSC has created four levels of PCI compliance based on the type of merchant.

- **PCI Merchant Level 1**: Merchants with over 6 million transactions a year, across all channels, or any merchant that has had a data breach
- **PCI Merchant Level 2:** Merchants with between 1 million and 6 million transactions annually, across all channels
- **PCI Merchant Level 3:** Merchants with between 20,000 and 1 million online transactions annually
- **PCI Merchant Level 4:** Merchants with fewer than 20,000 online transactions a year or any merchant processing up to 1 million regular transactions per year

## Impact of 4 Levels on PCI DSS Compliance

Depending on which of the four levels of PCI compliance your store falls under, your compliance journey can vary. Take the following scenarios, for example.

- If your store is considered a PCI Merchant Level 1, you’ll be required to undergo annual, third-party audits to verify compliance and go through an annual network scan by an approved scanning vendor (ASV). PCI Merchant, Level 1 store must receive an annual Attestation of Compliance (AoC) as well as a Report on Compliance (RoC).
- If your store is considered to be a PCI Merchant Level 2, 3, or 4, you’ll need to conduct the PCI DSS Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), as well as go through quarterly network scans with an ASV.
- If your store is deemed a PCI Merchant Level 3 but falls victim to a data breach that impacts cardholder information, Visa can opt to penalize you by making you also responsible for meeting the requirements of another level, such as PCI Merchant Level 1.
